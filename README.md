## Description & Screenshots

Application has been created with the help of modern web-development tools like React, SCSS, Typescript, and Material UI. Thanks to all of that it provides a great user 
experience, so that data can be seen clearly with the ability to sort and filter.
The project has two available themes: dark and light.
